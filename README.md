## Enabling GitHub Packages
Since this feature is still in beta at the time of making this video, you'll need to go ahead and enable it via the "Feature Preview" option

## Dockerfile
I have used a FastAPI python application in this tutorial.
You could essentially port this to any framework or language. I frequently use this work flow for `Go` applications.

__I Intend on making another video detailing how I use Docker in my development work flow, be sure to check my YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeR00eo9qKiY-z3VQPQPBA for more.__
